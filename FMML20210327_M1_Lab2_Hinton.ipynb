        "1. yes as we split the data set randomly so the accuracy changes to get more stable and consistent results averaging the Accuracy is good method\n",
        "2. yes as now we have have more consistent validation accuracy it give as better estimate of test accuracy\n",
        "3. as we increase the no of iterations the validation accuracy gets more stable, so we get a better estimate of the test accuracy. but it will saturate after a no of iterations.\n",
        "4. increasing the iteration will not effect the accuracy rather it give a more stable results. so if we have a small training set we will get a lesser accurate results but increasing no of iterations may not change the accuracy. but if we have a smaller validation set it will hard to get a correct estimate to check for overfitting so increasing the iterations may give a stable results which would be better to check for overfitting.
